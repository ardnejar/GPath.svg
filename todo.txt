TEST
  IE
  Adobe SVG versions
  Other SVG generators?
  Add testing

REVISE/REFACTORING
  more OOP, interact with function like so:
      gp = new GPathInfo(fileData.target.result)
      gp.file = theFile
      gp.decimal = document.getElementById('decimal').value
      gp.parseSVG(fileData.target.result)
  parse-svg-path! learn how to use node modules, uncommment-out module
  use normalizedPathSegList instead of my adjustPathPoint function
  separate each shape into classes
  loop over an svg object instead of creating GPath data structure

DEPLOYMENT
  javascript how do i deal with loading multiple files in development and loading min in production?
  minimize js
  documentation (user, developer)
  seperate parsing from layout (different github projects?)
  GitHub Pages? can they run grunt? if not where to host min version?
  domain?

OPTIONS TO ADD
  reverse order of shapes
  separate shape as independent variables, not group as array
  option to not convert to path (rect, line)
  remove duplcate points
  don't make last point when same as first point

FEATURES TO ADD
  separate view so it's not spread out among functions
  make this runnable from command line (node)
  move circle, ellipse, polyline to separate variable
  come up with a useful conversion for polyline, circle and ellipse
  curves to points
  curves to point fidelity options
  save modified svg file
  font to gpath

WEB INTERFACE
  style errors, file name
  toggle to hide generated code
  button to copy code
  display image by each group text (when multiple groups)
  mark 0 point in SVG preview
  reset 0 point in SVG preview
  preview color to black, white, or outline
  preview modified svg, next to original
  SVG + GPath side by side layout for wide browsers

WEB HANDLER
  check file is uploaded
  check that file is svg
  add handler on ready then activate button
