{"name":"Gpath.svg","tagline":"Convert SVG to Pebble GPathInfo array","body":"# SVG to Pebble GPath Converter #\r\n\r\nby\r\nRajendra Serber\r\n\r\n###What It Does###\r\n\r\nThis script takes a standard SVG file and coverts it to a Pebble GPathInfo array that can be drawn with gpath_draw_filled or gpath_draw_outline. SVGs with multiple shapes will have each shape as an item in the GPathInfo array. Each SVG group will be a separate GPathInfo array.\r\n\r\nSome primitive shape types are converted to paths. Rects and Lines can be drawn by Pebble when they are converted to paths.\r\n\r\n**Rounding**\r\nCurrently the only option that GPath.svg takes is \"decimal.\" This allows you to set how many decimal places the points are rounded to. Pebble doesn't have hardware accelerated floating point math, so avoiding floats where possible saves processing and therefor battery.\r\n\r\n###Limitations###\r\n\r\nThe current version drops any shapes that can't natively be drawn as a path on Pebble. Circles, Elipses and Polyline shapes can't be natively drawn by gpath draw. The curve data of paths is also dropped, leaving only the curves x and y values. Comments are added in place of the omitted data.\r\n\r\nThis has only been tested in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari (and should work in IE). There is no support for older browser planned.\r\n\r\n###How To Use###\r\nHow to coming soon...  \r\nGo to // to run in browser\r\nDependent on JQueary for xml parsing.\r\n\r\n###Contribute###\r\n\r\nThere is lots of room for improvement here. If you want to make this better please fork this repository and make a [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Every sensible change will be merged.\r\n","google":"UA-41475856-3","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
